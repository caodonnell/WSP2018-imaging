    "# Task 4: False-Color Images\n",
    "\n",
    "As you possibly figured out from the previous task, it's fairly easy to manipulate an image's colors to reflect something that isn't visible to the human eye. Most cameras are tuned to record the world in the same way that we see it, but some cameras are designed to do something different.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) images\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may remember from high school science classes, there are many different types of light, and the fancy term for it is the *electromagnetic spectrum*:\n",
    "![EM spectrum](https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/Images/science/EM_spectrum_compare_level1_lg.jpg \"from NASA's Imagine the Universe\")\n",
    "\n",
    "A few useful types of light are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Our eyes are tuned to what we call *visible* light (because it's what we see), but it's just a small portion of all the light out there. \n",
    "* Light that's redder than our visible red is called *infrared (IR)* light - it's what we use in heat lamps, and it's how a remote control communicates with a TV. \n",
    "* Light that's bluer than our visible blue is called *ultraviolet (UV)* light - it's what gives causes sunburns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before returning to our hurricane relief theme, we'll work with some other examples to explore IR and UV light. We can't actually \"see\" either type of light, but cameras can detect it. To visualize the radiation, we have to create *false-color images* where we use colors from the visible spectrum to represent \"colors\" in other wavelengths. As an analogy, when you opened the red, green, and blue images in DS9, you probably followed the directions and opened the red FITS file into the red channel and so on. However, if you had instead switched them - opened red as green and vice-versa, etc. - that would be a false-color image. In this case, we'll replace one of the visible color bands with IR and/or UV.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nature in visible versus IR\n",
    "\n",
    "First, download DunfieldCreek.zip from the file directory. When you open it on your computer, you'll notice there are 4 FITS images: the usual visible red, green, and blue, as well as an IR file. Using DS9, create a 3-color image using 3 of the bands. Since IR is essentially an \"extreme red\", a typical choice would be to use it in the red channel (and skip using the visible red FITS file), but feel free to experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare the IR image with the visible images. Are there regions of the photo where visible shows more detail than IR? What about IR showing more detail?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flowers in IR and UV\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, download cactus.zip from the file directory. This one only has 3 files - visible (\"vis\"), IR, and UV FITS files. Open these in DS9. What's similar or different about the details in the flower? Why might that be? (Hint: think about how flowers reproduce... they rely on pollination by bees and other insects).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other examples\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're interested in exploring this further, here are some additional examples of IR and UV imaging:\n",
    "* IR and UV imaging are useful in preserving artifacts by identifying different glazes, etc. on the surface. This can help archaeologists figure out how a piece used to look and/or restore it. An example is this [study at the University of South Hampton](http://acrg.soton.ac.uk/blog/4175/).\n",
    "* For more photos like the Dunfield Creek example, visit [that photographer's website](https://www.lifepixel.com/photography-gear/infrared-vs-color-images). He displays the photos with a slider bar to compare the visible and IR images.\n",
    "* For more flower images, visit [the photography blog](https://vis-uv-ir-flower-photos.blogspot.com/) I found the cactus flower images at. \n",
    "* And for more detail on flowers, visit [this research portfolio](http://myweb.liu.edu/~dhanley/flower/#portfolio) - click on the various categories to see which ones have high contrast in visible wavelengths (what humans see) versus UV (what bees and other insects see). If you click on the thumbnails, you'll see a 2-panel image with the visible image on the left and UV image on the right.\n",
    "* Even more IR and UV-based photography is available on [Craig Burrow's portfolio](http://www.cpburrows.com/independent-work/) - click on the \"Infrared\" and \"Ultraviolet-Induced Visible Fluorescence\" tabs\n",
    "* If you're really interested in this type of photography, [this technical guide](www.randombio.com/d90infrared.html) gives instructions for how to modify a camera for IR photgraphy."

    "## Using weather data\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning to our hurricane relief theme, it turns out non-visible light (especially IR) contains a lot of information about hurricanes. Up until now, we've primarily been focused on disaster relief - how do we find survivors, survey for damage, etc. But a key component of these efforts is what we learn from predicting where hurricanes will strike and with how much force.  \n",
