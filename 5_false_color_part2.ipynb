Note that different magnometers may report different numbers because of calibration issues, but what we care about is how things deviate (i.e., where there's more or less magnetic field strength).

When you click the button, you'll see a grid to enter your measurements. Working in pairs (or small groups), use the grid given to you to make measurements of the magnetic field strength around the object. Enter the measured values, and click the button below the grid to see an image made from your data (if the image doesn't appear, click the button a second time)."

By listening for the delay between when they emit the sound and receive the reflection/echo, they can tell how far away something  is.\n",
