If you use this function, it'll download the image to the Binder file directory, and you can use it in any of these programs using the given file name. Note that when you close the Binder, it won't save any changes including new files. If you want to use these images again, you'll have to re-download them."

Click on it, find your file of choice, and select it. Binder gives you an option to rename the file if you'd like, and then press the blue upload button. This is a good choice if you think you might want to re-use these images in other activities - again, Binder won't save any changes, but you can re-upload them the next time you want them rather than having to find the URL again.\n",
